# Iris-Flowers-Classification-Model
Developed an Iris flowers classification model in Python using Pandas, scikitlearn, and Matplotlib for data handling, algorithm execution, and data visualization respectively.

Applied a spot check technique to compare six machine learning algorithms and optimized the model selection process by Stratified K-Fold and calculating the cross-validation scores

Chose SVM algorithm as the optimized solution, yielding a prediction accuracy of 96.67%.
